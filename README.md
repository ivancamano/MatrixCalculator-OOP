**MATRIXPLUS **
     - Matrixplus is a Java-based calculator that solves basic operations of matrices. It contains addition, subtraction, multiplication, determinants, and matrix transposition. The idea of this project was to lessen the time consumed of the students while solving problems regarding matrices. It has a simple design made with scenebuilder and a user-friendly UI making the application easy-to-use. 

**TECHNOLOGY USED:**
Java, Javafx, Netbeans and Scenebuilder

**FEATURES/ OPERATIONS**

**Matrix Addition**
     - In addition of matrices, the elements of two matrices are added to yield a matrix that contains elements obtained as the sum of two matrices. The addition of matrices is performed between two matrices of the same order.
     
**Matrix Subtraction**
     - Subtraction of Matrices is the difference between the elements of two matrices of the same order to give an equivalent matrix of the same order whose elements are equal to the difference of elements of two matrices. 
     
**Matrix Multiplication**
     - In the multiplication of matrices, two matrices are multiplied to yield a single equivalent matrix. The multiplication is performed in the manner that the elements of the row of the first matrix multiply with the elements of the columns of the second matrix and the product of elements are added to yield a single element of the equivalent matrix.
     
**Transpose of Matrix**
     - Transpose of a Matrix is basically the rearrangement of row elements in column and column elements in a row to yield an equivalent matrix. A matrix in which the elements of the row of the original matrix are arranged in columns or vice versa is called Transpose Matrix.

**Matrix Determinants**
     - Determinant of a matrix is a number associated with that square matrix. The determinant of a matrix can only be calculated for a square matrix. It is represented by |A|. The determinant of a matrix is calculated by adding the product of the elements of a matrix with their cofactors.
